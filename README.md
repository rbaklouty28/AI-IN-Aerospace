# AI-Powered Martian Resource Mapping and Colony Expansion

## Overview

This project was developed for the **ATEC AI-Powered Hackathon**, organized by the **IEEE ESPRIT AESS Chapter**. The goal is to create an AI solution that autonomously maps potential resources (such as water ice and minerals) and identifies ideal colony expansion sites on Mars using images captured by exploration robots. The AI utilizes deep learning models to classify terrain types and predict resource-rich areas, assisting in colony planning and expansion.

### Key Features:
- **Terrain Recognition & Resource Mapping**: Classify Martian terrains (rocky, sandy, icy) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and predict resource-rich areas.
- **3D Terrain Analysis**: Reconstruct 3D terrain from 2D images for optimal colony placement.
- **Colony Expansion Simulation**: Simulate colony growth based on resource availability and terrain analysis.
